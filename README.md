2. softhddevice Patch

  The squeezebox plugin need a deblocked sound device, a blacked video 
  but avalible OSD output by the output device plugin. Exactly as I understand 
  the play mode 'ePlayMode = pmAudioOnlyBlack' (audio only from player, no video (black screen)).

  I use the softhddevice plugin in version 0.6.1rc1 as output plugin, to enable the pmAudioOnlyBlack support in the softhddevice
  the patch softhddevice-pmAudioOnly.patch (deliverd with the squeezebox plugin) is needed! 
  Therefore you habe to apply this patch and recompile softhddevice. Johns like to adopt the patch in one of the next versions.
  
  I don't know the behavior of pmAudioOnlyBlack relating to other output plugins like xine ...


3. LMC - Logitech Media Server

  Install the LMC on your server

    Logitech Version: http://www.mysqueezebox.com/download
    or the fork:      http://downloads.slimdevices.com/nightly/ (ich verwende aktuell die 7.8.0)

  Configure it via the WEB interface

4. squeezelite - streaming client for the LMC

  squeezelite is the the streming client used by the plugin
  Requirements: libalsa-dev libasound2-dev libflac-dev libmad0-dev libvorbis-dev libfaad-dev libmpg123-dev

  #> git clone https://code.google.com/p/squeezelite
  #> cd squeezelite
  #> make
  #> cp squeezelite /usr/local/bin/squeezelite
  #> chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/squeezelite

Configuration:
--------------

  Put this in the setup.conf (until the plugins setup dialog is implemented):

   squeezebox.audioDevice = hw:CARD=NVidia,DEV=9
   squeezebox.lmcHost = localhost
   squeezebox.lmcHttpPort = 9000
   squeezebox.lmcPort = 9090
   squeezebox.logLevel = 1
   squeezebox.playerName = VDR-squeeze
   squeezebox.squeezeCmd = /usr/local/bin/squeezelite

  And adjust the parameters to fit your system

  The possible setting of audioDevice are shown by calling:
  #> squeezelite -l
